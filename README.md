# Quinoa Tribute Project
#####~ An Es6 Webpack React Application ~



Live site can be viewed here: http://jimtheman.github.io/Quinoa-Tribute-React-Webpack/


This is a project that began from the yeoman generator react-webpack.


*Disclaimer: This was my first React project!*
*(Although I have done a lot of Angular and str8 Jquery front-end development)*

After scaffolding the project I added two components:

- a component that displays a single box (when I say box I'm referring to the dark grey box containing the text, title, and image). 
- a "container" component that makes three of the first component, passing in a type variable. of the three boxes, and 


I used the generator's component command to create the components which I liked a lot.

I also brought in React-Bootstrap to display the boxes nicely on mobile screens.


If you're curious to see how I felt about this generator and Es6 React in general check out my blog post here: http://www.wisdomofjim.com/woj-blog/my-little-react-webpack-project-postmortem


I'm always open to feedback so feel free to open issues with comments or suggestions. Thanks!  :)
